## Project Context

FrogBytes is a multifunctional lecture summarization & learning platform that helps students transcribe lectures, generate AI summaries, create study materials, and build a collaborative knowledge base.

### Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router and Turbopack
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **AI**: Google Gemini API for summarization, ElevenLabs for transcription
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit) + Playwright (E2E)
- **Type System**: TypeScript with strict mode + exactOptionalPropertyTypes
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage + Telegram archival system

### Code Quality Standards

This project enforces **senior-level, multi-billion company standards**:

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All strict compiler options enabled
   - `strict: true`
   - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
   - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
   - `noUnusedLocals: true`
   - `noUnusedParameters: true`

2. **Zero Tolerance**:
   - No explicit `any` types
   - No unused variables or imports
   - ESLint warnings cause build failures
   - All code must be formatted with Prettier

3. **Testing Requirements**:
   - 90%+ code coverage (branches, functions, lines, statements)
   - Unit tests for all business logic
   - E2E tests for critical user flows

4. **Performance**:
   - Minimize bundle size
   - Optimize re-renders
   - Use React Server Components where possible
   - Implement proper loading states

```

### Important Patterns

1. **Database Access**:
   - Always use the Supabase client from `services/supabase/`
   - Respect Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Use typed queries with database types from `types/database.ts`

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Log errors with context for debugging
   - Handle edge cases explicitly (null, undefined, empty arrays)

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Use Server Components by default
   - Add `'use client'` only when needed (state, effects, event handlers)
   - Extract complex logic into custom hooks
   - Keep components focused and single-purpose

4. **API Routes**:
   - Validate all inputs with Zod or similar
   - Use proper HTTP status codes
   - Implement rate limiting for expensive operations
   - Add JSDoc comments for all public endpoints

### Common Gotchas

1. **Optional Properties with `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`**:
   - Use conditional spreading: `{...(value ? { prop: value } : {})}`
   - Or build objects incrementally: `if (value) obj.prop = value`
   - Type guards don't always narrow as expected with this flag

2. **Supabase Client**:
   - Use `createClient()` from `services/supabase/client` for client components
   - Use server-side client for API routes and Server Components
   - Auth state may be null - always check before accessing

3. **File Uploads**:
   - Max size: 500MB
   - Supported formats: MP3, WAV, MP4, M4A, MOV, MPEG
   - Files are stored in Supabase Storage + archived to Telegram

4. **Testing**:
   - Tests are not yet implemented (will be added in Task #20)
   - Configuration files exist: `vitest.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts`
   - Test directory structure: `__tests__/` for unit, `tests/e2e/` for E2E

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Before starting work
npm run type-check        # Verify no TypeScript errors
npm run lint              # Check for linting issues

# During development
npm run dev               # Start dev server with Turbopack
npm run db:start          # Start local Supabase (if needed)

# Before committing
npm run lint:fix          # Auto-fix linting issues
npm run format            # Format all files
npm run type-check        # Final TypeScript check
npm run test:unit         # Run tests (when implemented)
```

### Current State (Post-Cleanup)

Recent refactoring has established a clean foundation:
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode fully enforced (zero errors)
- ✅ Jest removed in favor of Vitest
- ✅ Documentation consolidated (only README.md and this file remain)
- ✅ Test infrastructure prepared (configs ready, implementation pending)
- 🚧 Component organization needs improvement (Task #23)
- 🚧 Comprehensive testing to be implemented (Task #20)

### When Making Changes

1. **Read existing code first** - understand patterns before adding new code
2. **Follow the existing structure** - don't introduce new patterns without reason
3. **Type safety is paramount** - prefer type-safe solutions over quick hacks
4. **Test your changes** - ensure TypeScript compiles and linting passes
5. **Document complex logic** - add JSDoc for non-obvious behavior
6. **Performance matters** - profile before optimizing, but be aware of bundle size
7. **Security first** - validate inputs, sanitize outputs, respect RLS
