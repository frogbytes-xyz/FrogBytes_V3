# AI Copilot Context Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the AI Copilot to maintain comprehensive document context throughout conversations, enabling the AI to provide more accurate, lecture-specific assistance.

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Context Management (`app/api/copilot/route.ts`)

**Before:**
- Document context was only included in the first message
- Follow-up questions had no reference to the lecture content
- AI could "forget" what the lecture was about in longer conversations

**After:**
- Document context is included at the start of every API call
- System prompt establishes the AI as a learning assistant with access to lecture material
- Context is maintained throughout the entire conversation
- Clear instructions for markdown formatting and explanations

**Key Improvements:**
```typescript
// System context is now prepended to every conversation
if (context && context.trim().length > 0) {
  contents.push({
    role: 'user',
    parts: [{ text: `You are an AI learning assistant...` }]
  })
  contents.push({
    role: 'model',
    parts: [{ text: 'I understand the lecture content...' }]
  })
}
```

### 2. Visual Context Indicator (`components/AICopilot.tsx`)

Added a visual badge that shows when lecture content is loaded:
- ✅ Green checkmark badge when context is available
- Dynamic welcome message based on context availability
- Clear user feedback about the AI's knowledge state

### 3. Enhanced Markdown Rendering

**New Component:** `components/MarkdownMessage.tsx`
- Full GitHub Flavored Markdown support
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Styled tables, lists, blockquotes
- Proper typography and spacing

**Supported Markdown:**
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- Headings (h1, h2, h3)
- Ordered and unordered lists
- `inline code` and code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables with borders and styling
- Blockquotes
- Links (open in new tab)
- Horizontal rules

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. **Document Loading** (`app/learn/[id]/page.tsx:106-108`)
   ```typescript
   if (summary.latex_content) {
     setDocumentContext(summary.latex_content)
   }
   ```

2. **Context Passing** (`app/learn/[id]/page.tsx:279`)
   ```typescript
   <AICopilot documentContext={documentContext} isFocusMode={isExpanded} />
   ```

3. **API Context Injection** (`app/api/copilot/route.ts:54-80`)
   - Context is prepended to every API call
   - Gemini receives the full lecture content with every message
   - AI maintains awareness throughout the conversation

4. **Response Rendering** (`components/AICopilot.tsx:305-308`)
   - Assistant messages use `MarkdownMessage` component
   - Full markdown formatting applied
   - Code blocks get syntax highlighting

## Benefits

### For Students
- ✅ AI provides accurate, lecture-specific answers
- ✅ Can reference specific parts of the lecture material
- ✅ Maintains context across long conversations
- ✅ Better formatted responses with markdown
- ✅ Visual confirmation that lecture is loaded

### For Development
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Type-safe implementation
- ✅ Maintainable code structure
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing API

## Testing

### Test Scenarios

1. **Context Awareness Test**
   - Open any lecture document in `/learn/[id]`
   - Ask specific questions about lecture content
   - AI should reference the actual material

2. **Markdown Rendering Test**
   - Ask: "Explain bubble sort with code examples"
   - Verify code blocks render with syntax highlighting
   - Check formatting is clean and readable

3. **Conversation Continuity Test**
   - Ask a series of related questions
   - AI should maintain context from previous messages
   - No need to repeat lecture information

4. **No Context Test**
   - Visit `/test-copilot` page
   - Verify warning message appears
   - AI still functions but in general mode

## Configuration

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "react-markdown": "^10.1.0",
  "remark-gfm": "^4.0.1",
  "rehype-highlight": "^7.0.2",
  "highlight.js": "^11.11.1"
}
```

### Files Modified
- `app/api/copilot/route.ts` - Enhanced context handling
- `components/AICopilot.tsx` - Added markdown rendering and context indicator
- `app/globals.css` - Added syntax highlighting styles

### Files Created
- `components/MarkdownMessage.tsx` - Markdown rendering component
- `app/test-copilot/page.tsx` - Test page for copilot features

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Context Summarization** - For very long lectures, automatically summarize key points
2. **Citation System** - Link AI responses to specific sections of the lecture
3. **Multi-Document Context** - Allow copilot to reference multiple related lectures
4. **Context Visualization** - Show which parts of lecture AI is referencing
5. **Copy Code Button** - Add copy button to code blocks
6. **Export Conversation** - Allow students to export chat history

### Performance Considerations
- Large lecture content increases token usage
- Consider implementing context windowing for very long documents
- Cache frequently asked questions

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI doesn't seem to know lecture content
**Solution:** Check that `latex_content` field is populated in the database

### Issue: Markdown not rendering
**Solution:** Verify `react-markdown` and related packages are installed

### Issue: Code blocks have no syntax highlighting
**Solution:** Ensure `highlight.js` CSS is imported in `globals.css`

### Issue: Context badge not showing
**Solution:** Verify `documentContext` prop is being passed to `AICopilot`

## Technical Notes

### Gemini API Context Handling
- Context is sent with every request (not just first message)
- Uses conversation history format with system priming
- Model confirmed understanding before conversation starts

### Token Usage
- Lecture content is included in every API call
- Monitor token usage for cost optimization
- Consider implementing context compression for large documents

### Type Safety
- All changes maintain strict TypeScript compliance
- No `any` types introduced
- Full type inference throughout the stack
