# Feedback System Migration Fix

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Issue:** "Could not find the 'priority' column of 'feedback' in the schema cache"  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Problem Description

When attempting to create feedback/issues on the feedback page (`/feedback`), users encountered the following error:

```
Failed to create feedback: Could not find the 'priority' column of 'feedback' in the schema cache
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because:

1. **Base Migration Created Table** - Migration `20240120000000_create_feedback_system.sql` created the `feedback` table with basic columns (id, user_id, type, title, description, status, upvotes, downvotes, timestamps).

2. **Enhancement Migration Existed But Wasn't Applied** - Migration `20250115000000_enhance_feedback_system.sql` was meant to add enhanced features including:
   - `priority` column
   - `assignee_id` column  
   - `reaction_counts` column
   - Additional tables for labels and reactions

3. **Migration Version Recorded But Changes Not Applied** - The migration version was recorded in `supabase_migrations.schema_migrations` table, but the actual `ALTER TABLE` statements were never executed on the database.

4. **Code Expected Enhanced Schema** - The frontend code in `/app/feedback/page.tsx` tried to insert records with the `priority` field (line 373), which didn't exist in the database.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Investigation
- Examined feedback page code to identify expected schema
- Checked existing migration files
- Verified database schema using Supabase client
- Discovered missing columns in actual database table

### 2. Migration Application
Used the Supabase Management API to manually execute the ALTER TABLE statements:

```sql
-- Add priority column
ALTER TABLE feedback 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS priority TEXT DEFAULT 'medium' 
CHECK (priority IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent'));

-- Add assignee column  
ALTER TABLE feedback 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS assignee_id UUID 
REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

-- Add reaction counts column
ALTER TABLE feedback 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS reaction_counts JSONB DEFAULT '{}';

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_feedback_priority ON feedback(priority);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_feedback_assignee_id ON feedback(assignee_id);
```

### 3. Verification
- Queried database to confirm columns were added
- Created test feedback entry with priority field
- Verified successful insertion and deletion
- Confirmed schema now matches code expectations

## Current Feedback Table Schema

After the fix, the `feedback` table includes:

| Column | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| id | UUID | gen_random_uuid() | Primary key |
| user_id | UUID | - | User who created feedback |
| type | TEXT | - | issue, improvement, or feature |
| title | TEXT | - | Feedback title |
| description | TEXT | - | Detailed description |
| status | TEXT | 'open' | open, in_progress, completed, or closed |
| priority | TEXT | 'medium' | low, medium, high, or urgent |
| assignee_id | UUID | NULL | Assigned user (optional) |
| upvotes | INTEGER | 0 | Number of upvotes |
| downvotes | INTEGER | 0 | Number of downvotes |
| reaction_counts | JSONB | {} | Reaction counts by type |
| created_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOW() | Creation timestamp |
| updated_at | TIMESTAMPTZ | NOW() | Last update timestamp |

## How to Apply This Fix (If Needed Again)

### Method 1: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy the SQL from `/supabase/migrations/20250115000000_enhance_feedback_system.sql`
4. Execute the SQL
5. Verify in Table Editor that columns were added

### Method 2: Supabase CLI
```bash
# Link project (if not already linked)
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# Push migrations
npx supabase db push --include-all
```

### Method 3: Management API (Used in this fix)
See the script logic that was used - it calls the Supabase Management API's query endpoint with the ALTER TABLE statements.

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Always verify migrations are applied** - After running migrations, check the actual database schema, not just the migration history table.

2. **Use migration checks in CI/CD** - Add automated checks to ensure database schema matches expected schema.

3. **Add schema validation tests** - Create integration tests that verify required columns exist before running application code.

4. **Monitor migration status** - Set up alerts for migration failures or partial applications.

## Testing

To test that the feedback system works:

1. Navigate to `/feedback` page
2. Click "New Issue" button
3. Fill in the form with:
   - Type: Bug Report / Feature Request / Improvement
   - Priority: Low / Medium / High / Urgent
   - Title: Your issue title
   - Description: Detailed description
4. Click "Create Issue"
5. Verify the issue appears in the list without errors

## Files Modified

No application files were modified. Changes were database-only:
- Database table: `feedback` (schema updated)
- Database indexes: Added for `priority` and `assignee_id`

## Support

If you encounter similar "column not found in schema cache" errors:

1. Check which migration file should have added the column
2. Verify if the migration was actually executed on the database
3. If not, manually run the migration SQL
4. Clear any schema caches if needed
5. Test the functionality
