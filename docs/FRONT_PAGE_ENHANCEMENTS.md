# Front Page Enhancement - Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the front page with two major features:
1. **3D Image Placeholder** - An interactive, transformed placeholder with 3D effects
2. **File Upload Section** - Quick upload section that handles authentication flow

## Changes Made

### 1. New Components Created

#### `/components/Image3DPlaceholder.tsx`
A client-side component that creates an interactive 3D image placeholder with the following features:
- **3D Transformation**: Uses CSS perspective and transforms to create depth
- **Mouse Tracking**: Responds to mouse movement with rotation effects
- **Layered Design**: Multiple layers (front card, shadow, back layer) for depth
- **Floating Elements**: Animated particles for visual interest
- **Smooth Transitions**: Smooth animation when mouse enters/leaves

Technical implementation:
- Uses `perspective(1000px)` for 3D space
- `rotateX` and `rotateY` based on mouse position
- `transform-style: preserve-3d` for proper 3D rendering
- Multiple `translateZ` values for layering effect

#### `/components/HeroFileUpload.tsx`
A client-side file upload component optimized for the homepage with authentication handling:
- **Authentication Check**: Detects if user is logged in using Supabase
- **Smart Routing**: 
  - If not logged in → redirects to `/login?redirect=/upload`
  - If logged in → redirects to `/upload` page
- **File Validation**: Same validation as full upload component (500MB max, supported formats)
- **Drag & Drop**: Full drag and drop support
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid files
- **Temporary Storage**: Stores file info in sessionStorage for post-login retrieval

### 2. Updated Files

#### `/app/page.tsx`
Updated the homepage with:
1. **Two-Column Hero Layout**:
   - Left column: Headline, description, CTA buttons
   - Right column: 3D Image Placeholder (hidden on mobile, shown on lg screens)
   - Increased max-width from `max-w-5xl` to `max-w-6xl` for better layout

2. **New Quick Upload Section**:
   - Added between hero and features sections
   - Contains the `HeroFileUpload` component
   - Light background (`bg-accent/20`) to distinguish it
   - Clear messaging about authentication requirement
   - Centered layout with max-width constraint

## User Flow

### For Unauthenticated Users:
1. User visits homepage
2. User drags/selects a lecture file in the upload section
3. File is validated
4. If valid, user is redirected to `/login?redirect=/upload`
5. After login, user is redirected to `/upload` page
6. User can continue with the normal upload flow

### For Authenticated Users:
1. User visits homepage
2. User drags/selects a lecture file
3. File is validated
4. If valid, user is immediately redirected to `/upload` page
5. User continues with normal upload flow

## Visual Design

### 3D Image Placeholder
- Positioned on the right side of the hero section
- 500px height container
- Responds to mouse movement for interactive effect
- Uses gradient backgrounds and subtle shadows
- Contains placeholder content (icon, text lines, decorative elements)

### File Upload Section
- Clean, minimal design matching the site aesthetic
- Clear visual feedback for drag & drop
- Prominent "Select File" button
- Format and size information displayed
- Error messages shown in destructive color scheme
- Informational text about authentication requirement

## Technical Notes

- Both components are client-side (`'use client'`) due to interactivity requirements
- Uses Next.js App Router navigation (`useRouter`)
- Leverages Supabase client for authentication checks
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Follows existing design system (shadcn/ui components)
- TypeScript for type safety

## Browser Compatibility

The 3D effects use modern CSS features:
- `transform: perspective()` - widely supported
- `transform-style: preserve-3d` - supported in all modern browsers
- CSS transitions and transforms - full support
- Graceful degradation on older browsers (will show static placeholder)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to consider:
1. Add actual image/screenshot instead of placeholder
2. Implement file caching so file upload continues after login
3. Add preview functionality in the hero upload component
4. Consider adding upload progress indicator
5. Add more sophisticated 3D effects (e.g., parallax scrolling)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test authentication flow (logged in vs logged out)
2. Test file validation (various formats and sizes)
3. Test drag & drop on different browsers
4. Test 3D effects on different screen sizes
5. Verify mobile responsiveness (3D placeholder hidden on mobile)
6. Test keyboard navigation and accessibility
